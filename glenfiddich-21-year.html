                        <img src="https://wallofwhiskey.com/img/valley-of-deer.jpg" alt="valley of the deer">
                        <p>Glenfiddich is a brand that I've had many times over the years.<br><br> I was first introduced to it prior to bartending by my good friend Tyler Miller. Well not the 21 year but the affordable 12 year.<br><br> This opened my eyes and taste-buds to the wonderful world of Scotch and I'm ever-grateful to Mr. Miller for his contribution to my whisky wall!<br><br>I love the pear notes on the 12 year so I was excited to see what the 21 was going to bring to the table.
                        </p>

                        <h3>William Grant</h3>
                        <img src="https://wallofwhiskey.com/img/william-grant.jpg" alt="William Grant">
                        <p>I did a little bit of research into Glenfiddich's history to see how it all came to be and found the wonderful tale of family-man William Grant realizing his life goal of making whisky. <br><br>After many years of hard, hand-fueled labor, the first drop of whisky was poured on Christmas Day in 1887. <br><br>So if you're reading this on Christmas and enjoying a glass you can toast one to William Grant and his Son's for bringing us this wonderful expression!</p>
                        <h3>A very Dry Era</h3>
                        <img src="/img/dry.jpg" alt="dry era">
                        <p>After prohibition wiped out the majority of whisky operations across the lands, Glenfiddich was <em>one</em> of only <em>Six</em> distilleries that remained open due to one of his son's incredible business foresight and actually increased production during prohibition. <br><br>This almost brought the brand to a point of going broke until the repeal. </p><p>Then the flood gates opened and they became one of the most prosperous and prolific brands on the market.</p>
                        <img src="/img/barrels.jpg" alt="coopers">
                        <p>
                        They became the first operation to employ onsite "coopers" (the craftsmen responsible for barrel making) which lowered their cost and increased production; another idea from the son of William Grant.</p>
                        <h3>Revolutionizing the Process</h3>
                        <img src="/img/solera.png" alt="solera vat">
                        <p>In 1998 they started using a "Solera Vat" which is a process of aging that involves transferring the whisky from barrel to barrel at certain intervals and mixing it with an older product because the barrels never get fully emptied.<br><br> That means that any Glenfiddich 15 that you taste will have a little bit of the 1998 whisky in it!</p>
                        <p>[I'll go more in-depth on Solera Aging in one of the Whiskey Terms posts]</p>

                        <h3>Janet Sheed Roberts</h3>
                        <img src="/img/janet-sheed-roberts.jpg" alt="JSR">
                        <p>Janet Sheed Roberts was the last living granddaughter of William Grant and lived a very altruistic and fascinating life.<br><br> Not only did she take care of her aging parents and was the central figure of the family, but she took care of all of Scotland by becoming the first female lawyer in the country. <br><br>A tiny select batch of whisky was crafted in her honor and aged for 55 years. </p><p>Only 11 bottles of the signed Glenfiddich 55 "Janet Sheed Roberts" was made, one of which remains at the distillery in her honor. </p>
                        <img src="/img/glenfiddich-55.jpg" alt="glenfiddich-55">
                        <p>All other bottles were sold at auction and one has the distinction of being the most expensive spirit ever sold at auction, fetching $94,000 in 2012, with all the proceeds going towards charity. Sip on that 2 Chainz.</p><p><b>Incredible.</b></p>

                        <h3>Oldest Bottle</h3>
                        <img src="/img/glenfiddich-64.jpg" alt="glenfiddich 64">
                        <p>The oldest batch is the Glenfiddich 64 which was produced in 1937 and bottled in 2001 <br><br>That is straight-up time-travel! <br><br>Can you imagine the workers meticulously spreading out those grains with care and love, but with no concept of what life will be like in 2001?! <br><br>The dedication and foresight it takes to craft something knowing that you will likely never see it touch anyone's lips or taste it yourself is astounding.</p>
                        
                        <h3 id="tasting">Tasting</h3>
                        
                        <p><b>The Look:</b><br>Light Yellow, reminds me of the color of Olympia Beer. As you tilt the glass around it has that beautiful lacing that stays high up on the glass.<br><br>
                          <b>The Smell:</b><br>It smelled yellow, if that's possible. Like cedar wood with a pinch of hazelnut and very slight peat.<br><br>
                          <b>The First Sip:</b><br>Unlike the other whiskies so far, there was very little heat on the front of my tongue. It wasn't until I swallowed that I detected the heat on the back of the tongue and roof of the mouth. <br><br>A nice grassy straw flavor with the hint of peat on the sides of the tongue.<br><br>
                          <b>Second Sip:</b><br>On my second go-around I started to taste other sweet characteristics come out like maraschino cherry and taffy.<br><br>
                          <b>The Remainder:</b><br> It had a non-lasting heat and a rather shallow finish. None of the tastes or sensations remained in my mouth or on my tongue. It was as if I hadn't tasted it at all.<br><br>
                          <b>Conclusion:</b><br> I enjoyed the taste, but it just didn't have the personality I would imagine from Glenfiddich.<br><br> It felt very tame for my taste. I'd rather have a whisky that smacks me in the face! <br><br>Now it would be nice to enjoy late-night if you want something mellow, like a chamomile tea before bed time.<br><br>
